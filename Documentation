    In start.mod.f90 there is a new variable mzadhoc (line 69).
    If mz is set to 1, the program takes MZ and MZZ Matrices from an external file called mzadhoc.dat.
    The file  must be located in the folder files/.
    The data structure within the file is: rows-> genes; columns->traits.
    First is the MZ matrix and then the binary MZZ.
    All individuals will have the same matrices.
    MZ and MZZ won't mutate.
    E.g for a population with 4 genes and 2 traits the file could be:

            0.5  -0.5
            0.7   0.1
            1.0  -1.2
           -1.4   0.3

               1      1
               1      1
               0      1
               1      0
